# Retail Shelf Monitoring System

A real-time retail shelf monitoring solution powered by computer vision and machine learning. The system leverages existing CCTV infrastructure to automatically detect **out-of-stock (OOS)** situations and **product misplacements**, enabling data-driven shelf management and faster restocking decisions.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Real-time Shelf Analysis** using YOLOv12-M for product detection
* **SKU Recognition** via MobileNetV3 embeddings and FAISS similarity search
* **Planogram Compliance** with automated grid generation and SKU matching
* **Tracking with SORT** for temporal consistency across frames
* **Multi-threaded Architecture** for high throughput and low-latency inference
* **Cross-platform Optimization** with ONNX, OpenVINO, and TensorRT
* **Interactive Desktop App** (PySide6) for visualization and alert management

## ⚙️ Processing Pipeline

```
CCTV Stream → Keyframe Selection → Shelf Detection →
Image Alignment → YOLOv12 Detection → SKU Recognition →
Grid Mapping → Temporal Consensus → Alert Generation →
Desktop UI Display → Staff Confirmation
```

**Keyframe-based processing** minimizes redundant computation, while **tracking (SORT + Kalman Filter)** ensures temporal stability across frames.
